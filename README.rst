**pycombina** is a Python module for solving binary approximation problems.
Multi-dimensional binary approximation problems can be formulated including
a variety of combinatorial constraints (such as maximum number of switches,
dwell times and switching adjacencies) and solved using different methods.

For further information and usage examples, please refer to the documentation
at https://pycombina.readthedocs.io
