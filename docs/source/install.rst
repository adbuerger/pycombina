How to install
==============

Install on Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9
----------------------------------

Python version >= 3.5 is required to use pycombina. You might need root privileges to run the following commands:

.. code:: Bash

    apt install python3-pip python3-dev cmake g++ git
    
Depending on your setup, you might need root privileges in the following to install packages via pip and setuptools:

.. code:: Bash

    pip3 install setuptools numpy unittest2
    git clone https://github.com/adbuerger/pycombina.git
    cd pycombina
    python3 setup.py install


**Please note:** pycombina uses features available only from C++11 on and uses pybind11 [#f5]_ (a copy of pybind11 is shipped with pycombina).

For using the MILP-based combinatorial integral approximation solver ``pycombina.CombinaMILP``, Gurobi and it's Python interface ``guropbipy``  [#f4]_ must be installed.

For running the webserver-example in ``server/server.py``, Flask [#f9]_ is required, which can be installed by running

.. code:: Bash

    pip3 install flask


Install on Windows 10
---------------------

For obtaining Python 3 on Windows, using Anaconda [#f7]_ is recommended. For building the C++ extensions of pycombina, a 64 bit Visual C++ compiler is required, which can be obtained free of charge for private and/or academic use within Visual Studio Community [#f8]_.

After that, clone or download and unzip the pycombina repository from https://github.com/adbuerger/pycombina, open an Anaconda Prompt an run 

.. code:: Bash

    python setup.py install

from within the pycombina folder.

For using the MILP-based combinatorial integral approximation solver ``pycombina.CombinaMILP``, Gurobi and it's Python interface ``guropbipy``  [#f4]_ must be installed.
