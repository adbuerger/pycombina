Binary approximation problems
=============================

**pycombina** can solve binary approximation problems as they arise, e. g., within efficient solution of Mixed Integer Optimal Control Problems (MIOCPs), using different methods such as Sum-Up-Rounding or Combinatorial Integral Approximation [#f1]_.

Prior to solving, a binary approximation problem has to be formulated using :class:`pycombina.BinApprox`. The resulting object can then later be passed to one of the solvers contained in **pycombina**.
