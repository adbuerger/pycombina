/**
 * \brief Monitor class recording VBC files.
 *
 * VBC is a file format developed by Sebastian Leipert at the University of
 * Cologne for recording and visualizing branch-and-bound trees. This monitor
 * class uses monitoring data provided by the Combina solver to produce a VBC
 * file representing the branch-and-bound tree explored by Combina.
 *
 * VBC files can include information on the timing of certain events. VbcMonitor
 * uses an internal ChronoTimer using the system's steady clock to measure this
 * timing information if requested. The timer is started at the beginning of the
 * search and stopped at its end. It is reset on every restart. Because Combina
 * processes nodes very quickly and VBC only allows timing precise to a hundreth
 * of a second, an optional time dilation factor can be specified. All time
 * measurements are internally multiplied with the time dilation factor before
 * being recorded.
