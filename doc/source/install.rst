How to install
==============

pycombina has been tested with Python2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04. 

Required Python modules
-----------------------

The following Python modules are required:

- ``setuptools``
- ``unittest2`` (optional, for running automated tests)
- ``numpy`` (optional, for running automated tests)
- ``pyscipopt`` (optional, required for using SCIP (solver license required), see [#f2]_ and [#f3]_)
- ``gurobipy`` (optional, required for using Gurobi (solver license required), see  [#f4]_)


Required build software
-----------------------

For building the C++ implementation, the following packages are required

- ``python-dev``
- ``g++``
- ``cmake``

**Please note:** pycombina uses features available only from C++11 on and uses pybind11 [#f5]_ (a copy of pybind11 is shipped with pycombina).


Installation
------------

For system-wide installation of the Python module, run

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo python setup.py install


If you're working on development of the module, it's better to just set a link
to the containing folder, which can be done by running

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo python setup.py develop


To run the the automated tests, run

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py test


Tests for SCIP and Gurobi will be skipped automatically if they're not available.
