pycombina - Combinatorial Integral Approximation

**pycombina** is a Python module for solving combinatorial integral approximation problems. Combinatorial integral approximation problems can be formulated and solved

1. by a custom Branch-and-Bound algorithm (using fast implementation in C++, recommended),
2. by SCIP (using an MILP formulation, requires SCIP and pyscipopt)
3. by Gurobi (using an MILP formulation, requires Gurobi and gurobipy)

while the problem setup is widely automatized.
